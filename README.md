# WaveMachine
Just follow the schematic at the bottom if you want to re-create this.  
  
Use the buttons to switch between modes and use the knobs to control the waves.  
The servos will move exactly like the waves on the screen.

# I only made the code for this project. I didn't create the project iself.
You are allowed to use the code for your own projects. It would be nice if you add a link to this github page.
